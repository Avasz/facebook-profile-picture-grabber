Facebook Profile Picture Grabber
==================================

A `just-for-fun` python script to endlessly grab facebook profile pictures, starting from a reference profile.

I do not know the reason. I did it when i was learning python (i am still learning, btw). It helped me gain some knowledge of urlib things.
