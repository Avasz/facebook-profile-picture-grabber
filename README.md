Facebook Profile Picture Grabber
==================================

A `just-for-fun` python script to endlessly grab facebook profile pictures, starting from a reference profile.

Why? 
===

I do not know the reason. I did it when i was learning python (i am still learning, btw). It helped me gain some knowledge of urlib things.


Issues
======
Codes are bad. No optimizations, I don't even know if they comply with standards. So, it would bee cool, if you people just send amazing pull requests.  :)
